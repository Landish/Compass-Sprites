{"name":"Compass Sprites","tagline":"Compass Better Sprites","body":"# Compass Sprites\r\n\r\nIn order to use this mixin, I assume that you are already familiar with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and it's [Spriting](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/) feature.\r\n\r\nWhat this mixin does, is that, it uses CSS Contains Selector, which is [supported by every major browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sel3), including IE7 and above, rather than adding each class name to CSS, which represents the sprite file name.\r\n\r\nFor example, this code:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.icon, .icon-home, .icon-info, [class*=\"icon-\"] {\r\n  background-image: url('/images/icon-se150f5a3ac.png');\r\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecomes to this:\r\n```css\r\n.icon, [class*=\"icon-\"] {\r\n  background-image: url('/images/icon-se150f5a3ac.png');\r\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*When using few icons, it's not a big issue to use default spriting functionality from Compass, but if you have a lot of icons, debugging of HTML/CSS can be one hell of a process.*\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nYou can manually create `_sprites.scss` file and paste the contents of the [_sprites.scss](https://github.com/Landish/compass-sprites/blob/master/_sprites.scss) file in it.\r\n\r\nOr you can install with [Bower](http://bower.io):\r\n\r\n```\r\nbower install compass-sprites --save\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nLet's consider the following scenratio, where you have initialised Compass in your project with `compass init` command.\r\n\r\nCreate a `/sass/_icons.scss` file and fill it with the following content: \r\n\r\n( Example code can be found [here](https://github.com/Landish/compass-sprites/blob/master/_icons.example.scss) )\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n$icon-sprite-dimensions: true;\r\n$icon-layout: smart;\r\n$icon-sprite-base-class: '.icon';\r\n@import \"icon/*.png\";\r\n@include all-icon-sprites;\r\n\r\n[class*=\"icon-\"] {\r\n  @extend .icon;\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  vertical-align: middle;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your `/sass/screen.scss` file after importing `compass` import `sprites` mixin and `icons`:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"compass\";\r\n@import \"sprites\";\r\n// or if you have installed it with bower:\r\n// @import \"path/to/bower_components/compass-sprites/sprites\";\r\n@import \"icons\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note: If you don't import `sprites`, compass will use default spriting for generating sprites.**\r\n\r\nPut some icons/images into your `/images/icon/` directory and run the `compass compile` or `compass watch` command.\r\n\r\n*You can also compile Compass with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or any other 3rd-party applications, such as [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) or [Koala](http://koala-app.com/).* \r\n\r\nAfter compiling Compass into CSS, you can use the following syntax of code for displayng icons in your HTML:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<i class=\"icon-{filename}\"></i>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```html\r\n<i class=\"icon-home\"></i>\r\n<i class=\"icon-info\"></i>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThe Compass Sprites Mixin is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
